# Optical Character Recognition for Sanskrit Using Convolution Neural Networks

This project aims to develop an OCR for Devanagari Script(Samskritam text). This will help in Digitization of all the ancient material, and will also facilitate searches and tagging of text.

# Running the software

To Run the software Clone The repository and type "python run.py" on your terminal. This will run the software on your local server using python flask. 


# NOTE:

The OCR software is being migrated to another repository as a part of the Devdigitizer Project. Please take a look at the SanskritOCR repo for the updated OCR code.
